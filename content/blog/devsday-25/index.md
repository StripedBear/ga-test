{{< youtube "https://youtu.be/3GLH25M0L5E" >}}

Pillars of Eternity and Shadowrun Trilogy went to zero. Dungeonland, War of the Vikings, Warlock 2, Knights of Pen & Paper 2, Imperator: Rome and Empire of Sin failed. Succeeded: Cities in Motion 2, Empire, March of the Eagles, The Showdown Effect, Leviathan: Warships, Magicka 2, Tyranny, Steel Division: Normandy 44, Surviving Mars, BattleTech, Prison Architect, Age of Wonders: Planetfall, Surviving the Aftermath , Victoria 3, and Age of Wonders 4. It’s worth adding that Europa Universalis IV, Cities: Skylines, Hearts of Iron IV, Stellaris, and Crusader Kings III are “endless games” that are still supported today.

[Cut bonus, crunches and conflict with Interplay management: Tim Kane on leaving the Fallout 2 team](https://youtu.be/VyQgWh-XAxs)

{{< youtube "https://youtu.be/VyQgWh-XAxs" >}}

In the last video, Tim Kaine spoke about the conflict with Brian Fargo and about leaving the Fallout 2 development team. The release of the first part had to be postponed, because there was a floating bug. Tim and another employee had been fixing it for over a week. And when they fixed it, Brian Fargo tried to get the name of the one who was to blame for the bug. Tim didn’t give out the employee’s name. That very bug bug Fargo put on Kane himself, since he “did not give out the employee.”

[Valve’s “secret weapon”](https://youtu.be/9Yomqk0C6kE)

{{< youtube "https://youtu.be/9Yomqk0C6kE" >}}

An analysis of Valve’s approach to developing their games, which consists in constant playtests. Teams hold them every week, which allows you to change the game even in the early stages of development. For example, in the original version of HL2, the player only gets a gravity gun towards the end of the game. Playtests have shown that players really liked the mechanic, so in the release version we get these weapons in the early stages of the game.
