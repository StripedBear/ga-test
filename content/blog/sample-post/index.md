This is a **sample** blog post written in Markdown. Replace with your content.

You can add images to your post using the `image` shortcode:

{{< image src="example-image.jpg" alt="Example image" >}}

The featured image (specified in front matter or auto-detected) will be displayed at the top of the post and used as preview in blog listing and navigation buttons.
