*Our team of experts are committed to continuous learning and knowledge sharing. One of our Software Engineers, Denis, has a unique approach to programming that focuses on simplicity and strategic problem-solving. He believes that understanding how people think is essential in programming, as it begins in the mind rather than on a computer. While technical skills like programming languages and mathematical methods are important, the core of programming lies in the mental process and problem-solving abilities. Drawing from years of experience and a passion for mentoring, Denis has curated a list of best programming books that  act as essential resources for those looking to advance their programming skills, especially in game development and C++ programming.*
