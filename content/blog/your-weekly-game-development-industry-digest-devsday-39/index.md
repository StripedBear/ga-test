[**Balatro and Luck Be a landlord: How One Game Inspired the Other**](https://screenrant.com/luck-be-a-landlord-console-balatro-inspiration/)

<img src="balatro-Luck-Be-a-Landlord.jpg">

[Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) and [Luck be a Landlord](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1404850/Luck_be_a_Landlord/) stand tall as smash hits among niche gaming audiences. But what many don’t know is how similar the core design philosophies of both these games are. Luck be a Landlord was a big influence on Balatro with both games sharing similar unique deck-building mechanics, emphasizing luck and strategy, as well as roguelike features. [LocalThunk](https://www.reddit.com/user/localthunk/), the developer of Balatro stated:

_“The one largest influence on Balatro was Luck Be a Landlord. I watched Northernlion play for a few videos and loved the concept of a non-fantasy themed score attached roguelike a ton, so I modified the card game I was working on at the time into a roguelike.”_

{{< youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI7oCtvUi58" >}}

The Kyiv based [Haunted Dude](https://haunteddude.com/) is coming up with a narrative adventure game titled [The Demons Told Me to Make This Game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835690/The_Demons_Told_Me_to_Make_This_Game/), inspired by [Disco Elysium](https://discoelysium.com/buy-now) and [Slay the Princess](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989270/Slay_the_Princess__The_Pristine_Cut/). What’s exciting about this is that players would assume the role of a demon that advises incompetent exorcists in a demon-infested town. Focussing on mind-bending conversations and time manipulation, players would need to influence the minds of the characters in the game.

Gareth Damian Martin, the creator of [Citizen Sleeper 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442460/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector/) has made impressive games without using much coding. Instead, he uses tools such as Playmaker, Dialogue System for Unity and ink scripting language to build them. He admits modern tools make game development much simpler but also risky at the same time as it relies too much on specific softwares.

Based on his analysis of the [Mario Kart 9](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/#1) running on the upcoming console, Dulay highlighted that it looks like there will be some jaw dropping visual enhancements in the Nintendo’s next system such as true volumetric lighting, realistic dynamic shadows, and highly detailed textures. Plans are underway to share more about Switch 2 at the April 2 Nintendo Direct, with public demos available in select cities starting in April.

Unlike its predecessors, it opts for slower, more visceral gameplay reminiscent of the original 1990s [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)).

Inspired by [DoomPDF](https://doompdf.pages.dev/doom.pdf), Wojciech Graj is the person behind this project who ported Doom to a standalone Word document. However, it’s worth noting that there is no sound (yet) in this game release.
