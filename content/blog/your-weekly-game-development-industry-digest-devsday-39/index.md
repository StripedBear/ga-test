<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/" rel="nofollow">Balatro</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1404850/Luck_be_a_Landlord/" rel="nofollow">Luck be a Landlord</a> stand tall as smash hits among niche gaming audiences. But what many don’t know is how similar the core design philosophies of both these games are. Luck be a Landlord was a big influence on Balatro with both games sharing similar unique deck-building mechanics, emphasizing luck and strategy, as well as roguelike features. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/localthunk/">LocalThunk</a>, the developer of Balatro stated:</p>
<p><em>“The one largest influence on Balatro was Luck Be a Landlord. I watched Northernlion play for a few videos and loved the concept of a non-fantasy themed score attached roguelike a ton, so I modified the card game I was working on at the time into a roguelike.”</em></p>

<p>Gareth Damian Martin, the creator of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442460/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector/" rel="nofollow">Citizen Sleeper 2</a> has made impressive games without using much coding. Instead, he uses tools such as Playmaker, Dialogue System for Unity and ink scripting language to build them. He admits modern tools make game development much simpler but also risky at the same time as it relies too much on specific softwares.</p>
