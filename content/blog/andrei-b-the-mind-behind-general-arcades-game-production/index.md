*It’s 2025, and we’re thrilled to continue our series of interviews with the incredible minds behind General Arcade. Meet Andrei B., our Production Director with a career spanning over two decades in the IT industry, Andrei’s path to game production has been shaped by a combination of his expertise in management and his ability to navigate both the technical challenges and the human aspects of game development.*

“With over 20 years in various IT roles, I never specifically aimed to enter the game development industry, but the prospect always intrigued me. Game development is notoriously difficult to break into from the outside; even similar positions require skill sets that diverge significantly from other IT sectors. My entry was a combination of experience, circumstances, and my background as a seasoned manager.

My path to game production is quite unconventional. I began my career as a developer but quickly realized it wasn’t the right fit for me — it felt monotonous. Seeking more dynamic roles, I transitioned into consulting and university teaching. Over 11 years, I honed my communication skills by working with diverse groups, including developers, analysts, QA teams, managers, and directors.

This skillset led me to a project management role, where I tackled challenging clients and demanding projects. Despite initial hurdles, my first project succeeded, and I spent six years in project management, gradually moving closer to product development. Joining General Arcade was somewhat serendipitous; I was seeking a new opportunity, and they needed a manager for a major client.

As a producer, I oversee internal processes, manage projects, and lead recruitment efforts. My priorities shift based on project demands. If a project risks derailing, I step in with resource reallocation or closer oversight to keep it on track. My success lies in detailed planning, proactive communication, and a willingness to adapt when plans falter.

I think creativity can be a double-edged sword among developers, and unchecked attempts at innovation can lead to unforeseen consequences. Therefore,  balance is essential. While creativity and innovation are not the sole focus within my team, they are integral tools used strategically to achieve our goals.

When evaluating new hires, I value critical thinking, adaptability, and the ability to work independently. Communication skills and openness to constructive feedback are paramount. I seek team members who can contribute original ideas where they add value, collaborate effectively, and maintain a balanced, goal-oriented approach to creativity.”

— Andrei B.
