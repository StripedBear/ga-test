<p>Initially, the project’s goal was to release Gold Box on Steam. Original games had several bugs that were fixed in the process, and General Arcade specialista also added handy PDFs to the packages made. After it was decided to make a custom game launcher on Qt.</p>
<p>Launcher makes it easier for players to access necessary documentation (Journals, Manuals, Cluebooks, etc). It also provides a simple interface for selecting game language, changing resolution, enabling Gold Box Companion, launching internal game settings, dosbox settings and resetting in-game progress. And of course, import progress copies characters from past games in the series, allowing you to continue playing as them.</p>
