There are so many podcasts that it’s easy to miss an amazing but unpopular podcast. The General Arcade team encourages you to check out [The House of the Dev](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHouseofTheDev) podcast.

House of the Dev is a podcast hosted by developer Petr Salnikov and former head of Arkane Studios Rafael Colantonio. The podcast’s first season contains 9 episodes, eight of which have very interesting guests: Warren Spector, Harvey Smith, Viktor Antonov, Ken Levin, Matt Pearsall, Julia Cherenko, Jason Schreier, and Alexey Savchenko.

Behind each guest, there are years of work and dozens of stories. Add to that the charming and smart hosts, and you have a podcast that should never be missed (but for some reason it could happen).
