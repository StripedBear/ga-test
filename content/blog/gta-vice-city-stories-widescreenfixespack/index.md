<h2 id="h-sergey-s-story"><em>Sergey’s story</em>:</h2>
<p>Basically, it’s when you want to play an old game, but something isn’t working, it won’t launch, or you just want to improve some Quality of Life (QoL) aspects. So, you sit down and figure out what can be done, and if it’s not too complicated, you create a plugin that works like an official patch, usually without replacing any game files.<br/>There are also projects (plugins) for modern emulators of old consoles, like PPSSPP. I made QoL updates for my favorite, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/games/vicecitystories">GTA Vice City Stories</a>, since the game is only available on PSP and PS2. These updates include improved controls, script fixes for 60fps, right-stick camera support, and more.<br/>There are many different plugins, so it’s hard to encapsulate the entire project. Nevertheless, this project led me to meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAMKti4BBpIXcn779bDX3PCv7j9Bqbirm5k"></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gennadiipotapov/">Gennadii Potapov</a>. In 2013, Gennadii reached out to me, lacking the source code, and proposed a QoL update with widescreen support for Marc Eckō’s Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure. At that time, we couldn’t implement everything, but in 2022, a huge fan of the game from Australia contacted me, questioning why the game’s UI elements disappeared at 4K resolution. I’d never tested it at 4K, so I got intrigued.<br/>I ended up rewriting the entire plugin from scratch and suggested to Gennadii that we update the 2013 version in the official release, which we did.<br/><br/><em>Sergey’s passion and dedication to enhancing the gaming experience for others are undeniably inspiring. His work on WidescreenFixesPack not only showcases his technical skills but also his unwavering commitment in preserving and improving the legacy of classic games. We are immensely proud to have Sergey on our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/general-arcade/">General Arcade</a> team and excited to see what he will achieve next.</em></p>
