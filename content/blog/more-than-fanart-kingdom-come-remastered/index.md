Many gamers and developers often wonder how an X game would look on a Y engine. Thanks to talented artists and programmers, we can often see a rough answer.

[Leo Schmidt](https://www.artstation.com/aizen_myoo/store), a 3D artist with impressive experience who loves Kingdom Come: Deliverance. He set himself the goal to recreate the mood of his favorite game using the latest technology.

A little Blender, a couple of assets from the libraries, and Leo’s talent added to them and now we have an amazing work in front of us.

There’s no point in looking at the low-resolution preview. Just [follow this link](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/4X36z2) and you’ll see for yourself. Great job, Leo!
