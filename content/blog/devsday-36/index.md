<p>The new version has added Ray Reconstruction, which should improve the quality of traced images by removing noise. DLSS 3.5 also adds automatic scene change detection to prevent complex frames from being created when frames are generated between major scene changes. This is done by analyzing the camera orientation in the game for each pair of DLSS Frame Generation frames.</p>

<p>FSR 3, a solution similar to Nvidia’s DLSS 3, combines frame generation (Fluid Motion Frames) with upscaler (FSR 2) and latency reduction (Anti-Lag+). Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum will be the first to try this technology. FSR 3 will run on Radeon graphics cards as well as Nvidia and Intel GPUs.</p>
