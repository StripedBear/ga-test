<p><strong>Official message from SNEG Team:</strong></p>
<p>Last months the team was quite busy working on bringing Chasm: The Rift to consoles and at the same time introducing more tweaks and improvements for PC version. Today it all goes live. In order to celebrate it we are running a 50% promo on the game for Steam gamers.</p>
<p>But what about tweaks? Probably the most important PC update is a SteamDeck compatibility (which will be verified by the Steam team soon), but that’s just one of many. Here is the full list:</p>
<p>– Implemented aim assist feature for controller input.<br/>– Added configurable motion blur post effect into the game.<br/>– Improved controls (e.g. more convenient turning and non-linear acceleration).<br/>– Introduced a new custom difficulty level that allows individually set player damage, enemy damage and a number of spawning enemies based on different difficulty levels.<br/>– Implemented new crosshair configuration (shape, size, color) and improved crosshair preview with animated background.<br/>– Fixes the annoying inaccuracy of crosshair position and hit projection.<br/>– Implemented dynamic protagonist picture, a feature that changes the protagonist’s picture in the in-game HUD in accordance with health and picked-up devices during the game.<br/>– Added the following accessibility configuration options: non-stylized font, non-stylized font color and size and a plain color channel mixer.<br/>– Added Traditional Chinese language support.<br/>– Added the “Continue” option to the main menu. This option loads the latest save slot.<br/>– Improved mods support and prepared a guide to make it easier (friction variable)<br/>– Moved addon levels loading to the main menu for extra levels.<br/>– Improved the load time, all resources are loaded into the RAM.<br/>– Improved “menu” keyboard navigation with additional bindings: W/A/S/D is used for navigation and sidebar configuration, SPACE is used for on/off configuration options.<br/>– Added FPS lock configuration option.</p>
<p>We hope these changes will address some of your requests and make the gaming experience even better.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support.<br/></p>
