Everything take place in the near future, when you wake up in Penrose hotel – a rather cozy, but very incomprehensible and strange place. You are treated like a VIP, but there is one thing… you can’t remember why you are such an important guest!

General Arcade were the ones who worked on this release using our very own [Ghost Porting technology](https://generalarcade.com/ghost-porting/). Thanks to these unique techniques and tools we are able to port different titles to different PC stores and prepare DRM-free releases without even getting an access to the source code, just by having binaries. Which was goodly demonstrated with The Spectrum Retreat!
