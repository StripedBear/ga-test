At General Arcade, every game we work on goes through rigorous testing, refinement, and improvement. One of the minds leading this critical process is Elle, our QA Engineer, and a gamer girl. Her keen eye for detail ensures every game we deliver meets the highest standards.

Here’s her story:

Elle’s love for technology began at a young age, eventually leading her to pursue a degree in [Computer Science](https://www.utem.edu.my/ms/) with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Being a QA Engineer, Elle is dedicated to ensuring that every game we create meets the highest standards. Her day-to-day involves identifying bugs, running regression and smoke tests, and verifying every technical and performance aspect of a game. Right now, she’s working on Captain Blood, a project that recently had an exciting demo release on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3040220/Captain_Blood/).

*“I always thought the gaming industry was out of reach,”* she shares. Elle’s journey into gaming started long before her professional career. A gamer girl, she grew up immersed in video games. Her first love for games began with the iconic [GBA console](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/game-boy-advance-nintendo-switch-online-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOortDu18NX9M4tuB4DZ8-69OSgnjtKSs9dRoytr_keZaHfnSvMR4), where she fell in love with classic titles that involved storytelling, strategy, and adventure. These childhood favorites continue to inspire her today, shaping her appreciation for creativity and the immersive power of games. Too young to play some of the games herself, Elle would watch her siblings take the controls, often offering feedback from the sidelines, which she admits, was often unsolicited. Little did she know, those early experiences would eventually lead her to a thriving career in the gaming industry.

Elle credits much of her growth to the supportive environment at General Arcade, especially her QA Lead, Roman. *“He is always willing to help and guide me”.* she says. His mentorship has inspired her to stay calm and meticulous, even during challenging moments. For Elle, one of the many perks of working at General Arcade is the sense of teamwork. She appreciates how the team celebrates milestones together, supporting each other which promotes a healthy work environment for all.

When asked about what advice she would give for someone wanting to venture into the gaming industry, Elle offers some straightforward advice: *“The work can get monotonous, but staying organized makes all the difference. Take notes, stay focused, and keep your mind clear.”* This mindset has helped her tackle challenges, even during her early days when everything felt new and overwhelming.

Moving ahead, Elle is eager to continue growing her skills, take on new projects, and achieve more milestones in her career. She’s focused on becoming even more productive and skilled, positive that her hard work will lead to exciting opportunities ahead.
