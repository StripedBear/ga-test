Speed Brawl is a 2D combat-racer about moving fast and hitting hard! Maintain your momentum, build your combos, and unleash powerful special moves. Find your own fighting style, and assemble the finest team of brawlers ever seen. Then do it all again faster… faster… FASTER!!!

General Arcade [worked on Speed Brawl for eight months](https://generalarcade.com/project/speed-brawl/). Three programmers and two testers used Unity, C# and C++ to make cross-platform multiplayer for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Steam, GOG and EGS via Epic Online Services.
