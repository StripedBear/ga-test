<p id="ember1312">Sacchin’s journey into the tech world started with his dad’s nudge, who also studied in the US. Following his dad’s lead, he chose the cool <a href="https://www.digipen.edu/">DigiPen Institute of Technology</a> in Redmond, Washington. Sacchin thrived there, learning heaps about computer science and game development, setting the stage for his future career.</p>
<p id="ember1313">After graduating, Sacchin joined <em>The Forge</em> in San Diego, California, as a Graphics Programmer, where he quickly moved up the ranks to become a Senior Graphics Programmer. His time at The Forge was marked by big contributions to major projects, which fuelled his passion for game development.</p>
<p id="ember1315">Beyond the world of code, Sacchin has a rich tapestry of interests. Growing up in MidValley, Malaysia, he was all about playing football (soccer) and taking part in tournaments as a right-wing. Football’s been a big part of his life since he started watching matches on TV, even though coding and gaming now take up most of his time.</p>
<p id="ember1316">Sacchin’s also an avid gamer. He and his pals have been hooked on <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/"><em>League of Legends</em></a> for 12 years, and the game holds a ton of special memories for him. Recently, he’s been diving into the massive world of <em><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>,</em> taking on tough bosses and exploring open-world adventures. His gaming journey started with classics like <em>Halo</em> and <em>Counter-Strike</em>, laying the foundation for his enduring passion for video games.</p>
