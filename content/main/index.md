General Arcade have been longtime collaborators and we see the team as some of our most trusted partners working on titles like Duke Nukem: Megaton Edition, Metal Wolf Chaos XD with From Software, and some unannounced projects. Our team cannot recommend the General Arcade group enough and look forward to working with them for years to come.|devolver.png|Devolver Digital|Nigel Lowrie
We have worked with General Arcade to bring ION FURY to console. They are professional, dedicated and just a really great partner to work with. We are extremely proud and satisfied with the end result, and we look forward to doing a lot more projects together!|3d-realms.png|3D Realms|Mike Nielsen
We have worked closely with Gennadii and the team at General Arcade for a number of years on a wide range of projects including Shadowgate, Pitfall Planet and the 8-bit Adventure Anthology adaptations. We have always found them incredibly knowledgeable and professional, with a good eye for building long-term beneficial partnerships with studios like Abstraction. Their work is delivered on-time, to budget and with great care for project and client alike.|abstraction.png|Abstraction|Ralph Egas
General Arcade have worked alongside our own developers for many years ago, and have helped us face down many and varied coding challenges. I would not hesitate to recommend them to others. They are talented, courteous, efficient and all round great people.|indie-stone.png|Indie Stone|Will Porter
We've worked with General Arcade on all kinds of projects: from fixing some old forgotten classics to preparing for the release of a major IP on our platform in close collaboration with a publishing partner. Despite all challenges, I never doubted the team and we can't be happier working with them.|gog.png|GOG|Artem Shchuiko
