## Bring your games to the fastest-selling console in history

The Nintendo Switch 2 has taken the industry by storm — breaking sales records and setting a new standard for hybrid gaming. By **August 1, 2025, more than 6 million units have been sold worldwide** (_according to Nintendo’s latest financial results_).

Yet, while the original Switch eShop features thousands of titles, the **Nintendo Switch 2 eShop currently lists only 46 games (US store)**. This represents a massive opportunity for developers and publishers to bring their games to a huge, rapidly growing audience — and we can help you do it.

# Why the Nintendo Switch 2 is a Game-Changer
Compared to the original Nintendo Switch, the Switch 2 delivers major improvements in performance, graphics, and capabilities:

* **Faster CPU & GPU** — enabling richer worlds, higher frame rates, and advanced effects.
* **Increased RAM & Storage** — larger and more complex games run smoothly.
* **Enhanced Joy-Con Features** — new control options for unique gameplay experiences.
* **4K Docked Support** — console-level fidelity on the big screen.

# Four Ways to Maximize Switch 2 Potential

There are multiple paths to bring your existing or new titles to Switch 2. We can guide you through all of them:

* **Backward Compatibility**
Most Nintendo Switch 1 titles run out of the box on Switch 2. Many even see small performance gains depending on architecture — no patches required.
* **Conditional Implementation**
Switch 1 games can detect when they are running on Switch 2, even without the Switch 2 SDK. Developers can unlock frame rates or enable enhanced visuals for immediate improvements with minimal effort.
* **Upgrade Pack**
Release a digital add-on to boost your Switch 1 title with Switch 2-exclusive enhancements. This can be free or paid, giving you flexibility in how you deliver value to players.
* **Switch 2 Edition**
Build a fully enhanced version of your existing game for Switch 2. This definitive edition leverages the full hardware power for the most complete upgrade possible.
