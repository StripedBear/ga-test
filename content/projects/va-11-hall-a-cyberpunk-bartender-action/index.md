So now you can turn to a bartender at VA-11 Hall-A, affectionately nicknamed &#8216;Valhalla.'

Keep your clients lubricated and you will be made privy to the most interesting stories.

The experience of VA-11 Hall-A offers a branching storyline where your decisions do not depend on traditional choices, but through the drinks you prepare. Get to know your clients, their tastes, and prepare the drink that will change their lives.
