The year is 2029, and mechanically augmented humans have now been deemed outcasts, living a life of complete and total segregation from the rest of society. And that was the year when General Arcade's Software Engineer and QA Engineer worked on DRM-Free version for GOG with Galaxy integration using Custom engine and C++. It took us two weeks, but you received the game several years yearier&#8230;

Now an experienced covert operative, Adam Jensen is forced to operate in a world that has grown to despise his kind. Armed with a new arsenal of state-of-the-art weapons and augmentations, he must choose the right approach, along with who to trust, in order to unravel a vast worldwide conspiracy.
