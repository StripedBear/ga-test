ENDLESS™ Dungeon is a unique blend of roguelite, tactical action, and tower defense set in the award-winning ENDLESS™ Universe. Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters&#8230; or die trying, get reloaded, and try again.

General Arcade was brought on to the project to help with the following tasks:

- EOS integration
- XB1/XSX/PS4/PS5 tailoring and online features
- Optimization
- Bugfixes
