Roombo: First Blood is a comedic, top-down, stealth-action game about being a robot vacuum cleaner and fending off burglars from your home. A short, experimental game and the first in the JUSTICE SUCKS series. Our Software Engineer and QA Engineer worked with Unity and C# on Xbox One adaptation for two months, and trust us - that was enouth for general porting, optimization and bug fixes.

Hack smart-home gadgets like lights, doors and various appliances to set up traps, or improvise weapons from objects around the house. Hide under furniture, set your trajectory and plow into your enemies, knocking them over with such force that they go flying, then munch them up when they’re down.

But make sure you don’t leave too much blood on the carpet, because you’ll need to make sure the house is clean before the family gets home. Only you can save Christmas and show these burglars that justice sucks!
