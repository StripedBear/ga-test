Two programmers from the General Arcade team worked on porting the game to the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series for five months. Then the testing phase began, which took a month and a half and two testers.

Development environment: Visual Studio, programming language: C++. The Forge was used for graphics, SoLoud for sound, additional code was written in C # and Python for utilitarian purposes.

All rendering in the game has been replaced with a cross-platform version (including mathematical operations and shaders), which works on PS5 and Xbox Series X. The sound/music playback and starter videos have also been replaced with a cross-platform version (while the sound is done with a relatively generic approach, a custom resolution was used for the videos). Of course, achievements were added😉
