In Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure you play as Trane, a &#8220;toy&#8221; graffiti artist with the street smarts, athletic prowess and vision to become an &#8220;All City King&#8221; - the most reputable of all graffiti artists. Along your quest, uncover the mayor's deep, dark secret and use your fighting talents and high-wire graffiti to expose the city's leader as a corrupt tyrant.

As you struggle to save a neighborhood from an oppressive government, one question stands out: What if graffiti could change the world? Risk your life battling city authorities and rival graf gangs - mere obstacles in your attempt to get your tag up. And in this city, not just any tag will do. You have to &#8220;Get IN, Get UP and Get OUT&#8221;.

General Arcade's two Software Engineers helped you to start the revolution. The guys were working with Custom engine and C++ for two weeks to prepare the game for digital publishing. They also added modern resolutions support, including widescreen ones. All done without access to the source code.
