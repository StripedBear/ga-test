FromSoftware originally released Metal Wolf Chaos in December 2004, appearing exclusively on the original Xbox and only in Japan. The game went on to become somewhat of a legend as it was hard to acquire and even harder to play outside of Japan with most fans experience of the game through YouTube videos and the occasional screenshot. Devolver Digital and FromSoftware have partnered together with developer General Arcade to modernize Metal Wolf Chaos with updates to the game including upgraded visual fidelity, refined controls and gameplay, a new save system, and 4K + 16:9 support for modern displays.

Our guys were the ones who brought you the new version. And damn, that wasn't easy&#8230; We needed five Software Engineers, two QA Engineer, Producer, Artist and two 3D Modelers, who worked for sixteen months! Modified PhyreEngine, C++ and FMOD were used as well as Direct3D 11 for Xbox One and GNM for PlayStation 4.
