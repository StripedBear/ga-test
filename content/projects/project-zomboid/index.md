Project Zomboid is an open-ended zombie-infested sandbox. It asks one simple question - how will you die? I said &#8220;you&#8221;, not &#8220;us&#8221;&#8230; Two of our Software Engineers and QA Engineer already did everything for us to survive! They spent more than three years using Java, C++, OpenGL, custom Opus based VoIP solution (developed by us) and RakNet for it. So we are safe now.

In the towns of Muldraugh and West Point, survivors must loot houses, build defences and do their utmost to delay their inevitable death day by day. No help is coming – their continued survival relies on their own cunning, luck and ability to evade a relentless horde.
