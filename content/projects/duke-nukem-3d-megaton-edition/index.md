Our studio developed OpenGL based port for Windows, Mac and Linux. We also redesigned the game UI to meet Steam Big Picture requirements and integrated Steamworks features (achievements, steam cloud, trading cards, workshop, multiplayer). It was a big project - five months and two Software Engineers and Artist working with BUILD, C, C++ and OpenGL. Big and great project.
