Phoenix Point: Year One Edition is the definitive version of the acclaimed strategy game from the creator of X-COM, collecting all previously released DLC, updates, and additional content. Our Software Engineer in pair with QA Engineer were working on the project for two weeks and prepared the DRM-Free/Galaxy version of the game for GOG by using Unity and C#!

The Earth has been overrun. A mutating, alien menace threatens the last remnants of mankind. Only the Phoenix Project, a secret organization of the best minds and bravest soldiers left on earth, can repel the aliens and reverse the inevitable. It's up to you to lead the Phoenix Project: research and develop new technologies, explore a ravaged globe, build your bases, manage resources, and dominate the battlefield.

But you won't be alone. Factions, including the corporatist New Jericho, the indecisive Synedrion, and the fanatical Disciples of Anu, as well as offshoot subfactions, have their own values and view of the Pandorans. You can choose to work with factions via Phoenix Point's diplomacy system, or you can simply crush all around you with military might. No matter what you choose, it won't be an easy victory.
