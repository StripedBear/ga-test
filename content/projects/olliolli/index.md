Compete across the world in all modes to get the highest scores on every Level and Spot. Daily Grind gives you 24 hours to challenge the world at a randomly selected Spot. You can practice as many times as you like, but you only get one chance to set your score.

It was General Arcade who was responsible for porting this PlayStation Vita game to PC. Two Software Engineers, three months, Custom engine, C++ and OpenGL - that was the right recipe to make it!
